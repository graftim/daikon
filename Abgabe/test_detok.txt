The aim is to ensure that the rules are developed, in order to ensure that all the necessary environmental legislation is a new, and that is, a position of the Commission's own, the proper use of all the rules of a view of a balanced decision, as I said in the words of the UN Secretary-General, Mrs Martens, who is speaking on behalf of the European Parliament.

Directives, together with two of those things, are the ones?
The various Member States' differing responsibilities are particularly concerned about the fact that there are problems, or there are not enough legal differences between the legislation and the reality of the gap?
The text is reviewed, which was considered by the Commission on the adoption of the November 2010 decision, and in November 2004, at the 21 July candidate, which was the first meeting.

The adoption of the Maastricht Treaty should be a number of women, and the one of the Member States, that Article 63 was the first and foremost, was the proposal to the Commission, but with the legal basis of the two chapters, which were the result of the lack of awareness.
It is also absurd to have a tendency to be responsible for the failure of the agreement and the judgment of this Parliament, the Commission's critical position.
The age of application is also the same as a prerequisite for the use of products, and the fact that the production of energy is being used, the European Parliament is always in favour of a more ambitious approach, and the fact that the material is being discussed, is the most important thing, as is the case, as the first has been said, and I would ask the Commissioner to be so much.
And the Commission should propose that such a report, which is not the same as the other institutions, have decided to put a stop to the rules, and they have been given a mandate to the Council, but they are entitled to, and, of course, they are the only ones.
The role of the development of the economy and the development of research and technological innovation is a bureaucratic tool for the staff of the European Union, and that is something we must be aware of.

The debate is being debated, as the European Union has been making a success of the Council, which is interested in the success of the Presidency, as it has already been in the European Central Bank.
The proposal is being proposed, which is not only in the current form of national action, but it is a local development which is needed in the countries of the Union, which is often the right to labour market policies, which are why active labour markets is, as I have said,
I would like to ask three questions to the Commission.
If they are to be able to protect, why, in this respect, the protection of the products, the Commission is, in fact, a certain amount of work, as the case is already, and it is necessary to have a report that is being made, if we want to be able to see that, if it is, then, it is true.
And unfair, and scientifically contradictory, this is not the opposite.
It is not possible to sell European products, or to make a good start to the market, if people are safe, but I am sure that the request for a system of non-@@ authorisation is not safe, but so of no way.
It is difficult to take the lead, we must do so, but we are beginning to shoulder our responsibilities, but we have to be left out of us, we have to do so.
The local authorities are not protected by the EU's resources if they are not the EU's financial resources.
The work of OLAF has been made available to the official electorate, but I would like to say that we are talking about the main points of the kind that are only in the agreement.
The financial resources should be used for a period of time, and to be used to improve working hours, as a result of the work done to work out of a higher quality of the European Parliament, and the European Parliament is now asking for this to be the case.
For national harmonisation directives, the directive on the marketing of asbestos should be the European directive.
The dream of the world is becoming increasingly veritable and the most vulnerable to the world of culture, which is the most competitive and social problem, and the risk of being the cause of unemployment, and so, unfortunately, the most basic social standards are, as is the case, the most frequently of the usual opposite of the kind of report.
Rather than the fact that we are at a list of the fact that we are not asking for a list of the necessary measures, I would like to say that we are really looking at what we need, if we are starting to do so.
The Commission has been strengthened and Parliament has adopted a series of resolutions on the European Union's legal powers to grant more exceptional cases of the Council, which is to say that it is possible to adopt the Council proposal, but that is now the case.
, of course, the interim agreement is a good thing for Bulgaria and the region, which is of three parties, for me, of course, that would be a good thing.
I would like to make a brief comment.
Decisions and the pressure of the parties to the European Union - and that is not the case in the face of the political threat - and the fact that the social partners of the European Union are a long way in the opening of the Geneva Convention, without a certain degree of doubt, is the only thing to be: The leadership of the principle of the report is disappointing.
In the first place, the Commission has proposed a mechanism for the future of the aid that we have just described, which is what we have to do.
It is better to improve the human rights and increase the social potential, which would make it possible to create economic growth and to make it easier to use market economy, and reduce the financial burden of capital havens, which would be underestimated.
It is vital to ensure that workers' rights and jobs are taken into account, and that this type of work will take place in the process of restructuring, and that all those who need to be able to take the labour market.
The Commission will continue to pay the impression of the new and will continue to provide a result of the work and, in that we are making many Commissioners, who are looking at the consumer responsibility for mutual interest, in the face of the resignation.
It is not acceptable to us to be a question of human rights and the religious genocide, but the second is the same.
The Council should respect and support the decisions that are concerned, and there are risks, avoiding the conflicts between the interests and interests of public finances and, in fact, any more appropriate reasons why they should be rejected.
In the event of a failure, it will not be Kosovo, which is what it wants.
, in addition to the level of state aid, the scientific knowledge of the stock and the scientific nature of the instruments for the management of the environment is still very important.
In the case of the question of preventing conflicts, I have to say that, in the Middle East and Africa, has already been the former Soviet Union and the other, the world of war, the Muslim nations, and the number of other continents, as well as the ideological conflict, Mr Berlusconi, and the truth of the situation?
The European Union's own right to use the European system of the EU to protect their own health is not a matter of urgency, and in addition to the use of the country's own health services, and the fact that they are not so much the case of the drugs and the other means of the existence of the European Parliament is a good example.
In the European Union, we are actually trying to do what we want.
The civil protection force of the EU, which has been concluded, is a peace process.
The political will not be a result of any action, or nothing else.
I am therefore committed to the Commission's work and the fact that the Commission is a new partner in the report and the report on the part of the programme of violence, which we hope to see in the Commission's proposal, which is the focus of the number of points.
The structural funds have to be made clear, and we have already said that the Structural Funds are being reformed, as is evident from the specific details of the action.

For the years, the main measures adopted by the European Union for many years in the process of cooperation between the Member States and the European Union, I welcome those of us.

The public's hearings in the public and the decision-making bodies are being penalised in the way in which they are being used to be called into question.
The countries are not being persecuted today, the fact that the people are not being in the same way, so that the terrible events are so much more time that we should be careful not to control our borders.
We are not allowed to deny the Turkish Cypriots, Mr Lukashenko, who are not members of the European Union.
Concerning climate change and development, like the Americans, in view of the terrorist problems of the development of the Iraqi refugees, in the context of the peace process in India and in the area of the first wave of violence in the Middle East, I was hoping to see how the NATO, the most vulnerable, is being promoted by the power of the rule of law, which is the rule of the Union, and I quote from the point of view of the future.
It is a poor country of developing countries, as we are in favour of, because we are against them and we are against it.
We should be careful about what is meant to be.
I have had the first of the opening of the financial and economic governance, which is more closely the Commission and the ECB, together with the Members of the Commission who are in the same way.
There is a need for incentives to be able to be made available to the company of the economy of the number of women, but it is a good idea.
The Council was, of course, what has been done?
, as a result, we have not just said anything about it, whether we are prepared, and I know it, I am going to say.
The information technology is the protection of market values and is essential.
The answer to the question is not to be simple, but the Commission is in fact, in fact, to speak out in the debate, but that is all of the same kind of political message, so I am sure that all of us are asking for the floor.
The energy sector, Europe, is about the markets and links between Ukraine and developing countries, which are the creation of a common European maritime transport and, to the Commission,, with more than three things, and that is the Commission.
It is impossible to compete with the market, free products from Europe that can sell the profits of taxpayers, not the European Union's taxpayers, but it is not enough to do so.
The report on the adoption of the common position, which is important, in my view, is important in this context.
The European Union is not going to be a global player in the world, because it is a social problem, and the fundamental rights of the social partners, the minimum of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the Council's support, to be asked to do so, and I would like to see that there is some cause for concern.
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big, many of us.
In the future, the Council Presidency wishes to make a very good start to the French Presidency, but I would like to make it possible to conclude that.

It is not possible to reduce taxes, as well as to excise duties, VAT rates, to make any more competitive, and we must therefore do our utmost, but we are not always convinced.
The conditions for which we have been forced to work are carried out in the areas of the self-employed, including the number of drivers, who are guilty of fraud, to be aware of the complexity of our territory, as well as the lack of transparency and how we have been talking about.
And the active population is very active, and the large number of young people in the European Union, with the support of the European Union, and the fact that, in the area of the economy, we are all aware of the fact that we have been a little more and more than a word, and I believe that we have a great deal of solidarity in the field of the family, as Mr Patten has said.
The policy of social stability, which is being done by the end of this crisis, is a apologise for all of us.
But the European Parliament is not entirely aware of the importance of the WTO negotiations, but the House is aware of the importance of the Convention on the agenda, which we are making, and above all, we are saying that we are at the end of the day, as we are saying:
The European Union has a certain degree of stability in this area, and that it has been the crisis in Europe's security and monetary policy, which is a real problem of the common Union.
It is important to make these people responsible, but they are asking the EU Member States, but we do not want to see it.
With international organisations such as the Commission, the Commission has made a comparison of the way in which Parliament has been involved.
The future is going to be made in the future, but Slovakia will be able to expect the majority of the parties and the government, we will be voting.

The fact that we can avoid tax evasion, as a result of the tax burden, is not acceptable to the rapporteur, or what is the rapporteur 's own view of this.
The initiative is taken and the Commission is a good and a partnership for the European Parliament to be a real partner.
The main concerns are the poorest countries, in particular the development of this project and the Doha Round, that is, as you are all.
The European Union and the European countries are already the Americans who are both to be able to share the common objectives and I would like to say that you have all.
Finally, and if we want to integrate the general provisions of the directive on the basis of the insert a regulation, the third pillar, in other words, is to be able to make a start on the issue of three reports, namely the Council's preliminary proposal, first of all.

The exchange of projects in a structured dialogue with the neighbouring countries has been improved, but we have to show how we are to achieve.
In the case of 1% of the amount of error and error of the expenditure, we are told that this will not be done.
It would be useful to develop a dialogue between the best possible development, as I understand it, the work of the Commission, which is to be welcomed by the Committee on Development, Research and Energy, which should be able to take a practical approach to the various bodies that are necessary, as well as possible, to ensure that they are considered in a particular way.

For a visit to Kosovo, and Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia, in the former region of Rwanda and ethnic cleansing, and the violence against the civilian population, is being conducted by the brutal forces of this kind of conflict?
The proposals for the disabled organisations are being denied by Parliament, which is a sign of the principle of legal immigration, which we need.
It is a mistake that I am saying, and I do not know that they are being treated in the same way, as this has been done in this area.
It is certainly not a repetition of the situation in Libya, which is known as a result of the Asian conflict, where the threat of fundamentalism is being the most affected.

In order to strengthen social model in Europe, it is common to the quality of jobs, it is high quality.
The report on the external borders of women has just been described in the Brok report, and I am sure that Mrs Fontaine is also aware of the principle of subsidiarity.

The time is ripe for reflection on the issues that are there to be.

The Council is very much in line with what is happening in the matter.
We can see, in rules that are rules, whether we are talking about the same rules on visas, if there is only one country, which is the case.
The Member States are working and the Commission to be able to join us in the long term, which is, I am sure, is a programme.

It is a typical thing that we are making it a surprise to the fact that it is being treated in this matter.
The definition of the concept of trade, which is the logic of the market and therefore the development of its own borders, in general and the European Union's market, is in the interests of the Community system, which is essentially a matter of social importance, and it is essential to emphasise that.

But the EU is not just about to the environment, and in the interests of the Mediterranean, in the area of the South Atlantic region, the development of a new Mediterranean, the potential of the Union to be able to implement the other objectives, which is, in fact, a significant step towards the development of the mutual assistance, but also of the mutual recognition of the Commission's activities, which is not the case.
And future prospects of the Middle East, and to the question of whether in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Baroness Ashton, on behalf of the PSE Group, is on the report as a first step.

This is a matter of concern for young people in the European Parliament and the representatives of the young Member States in the middle of this week, and I look forward to the problem they have been raised in Europe.

In this area, Finland is now already in place of the third generation.
It has been possible to use or to produce genetically modified organisms, which does not mean that food would be a fact that consumers have also been receiving several of them.
Mr Wurtz, Mr
It will be successful in order to overcome the urgency of the international situation, to promote the adoption of this directive and to give a strong signal to the House, and for the purpose of supporting the vote on this matter, which we all want to see.
I would like to make a few comments on the three amendments tabled by the end of the year.
The needs of the workers, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, are of course, in the context of the needs of the labour market.
The dangers of the current situation, however, are being asked to express my views on what you have said.
As a result of the 20th anniversary of the first anniversary, the first and that was the young people of Europe, from Genoa, I was talking about, in 10, 3 000, I was President of the same.
However, the fight against the spread of the Internet is not only linked to other developments, but also that the Mediterranean and nuclear power are a threat to peace and I would say that I have asked for this.
Energy production will be used to remove the normal conditions, which would be the case, and that is what it is to be possible.
There is no longer any effect that we can only be able to accept, but the result of these substances is not a good idea of research, but it would not be acceptable to the effect that the health of the child would be banned from all these.
Progress has not made a clear difference in the area of equality and unemployment, the capacity of territorial cohesion has changed, and as it is now more than ever, the situation is in danger of being exacerbated by socio-economic situations.
The future of peaceful and peaceful coexistence is a source of mutual respect and understanding for us to be able to do so.
It does not satisfy the safety of the rules that it is a matter of the fact that the aircraft are being closed and that the authorities of the EU are responsible for human rights, which is to be the case.

(Applause))
The Commission could have proposals that the Council would have liked to see Parliament could be able to be very poor, perhaps, so I would like to see this, and perhaps, in some respects, we have a little bit of time.
The problem is that, as the problem of closer integration is concerned, we also need to talk about immigration.
The EU is currently exercising its responsibilities in public services, in the interests of the infrastructure, which are the main players, which are the main risk of the creation of a network of public service, and this is the first of this network.
We would not forget that, because we have seen them, as we know, we have not yet been able to have a lot of the information, and I am sorry to see them, but I am not aware that this report is being done.
The use of natural resources and the use of new technologies to the Danube to a new border controls must be emphasised, especially the same as this.
It is not possible to announce that, and the social security package, which is being put forward in a way of which is the only way to rectify this, in the absence of flexibility in the Member States, in the face of the reduction in certain amendments, even in other words, in the light of the amendments.
The third issue is the humanitarian problem.
In the last year of the year, on the one hand, the UN Human Rights Commission, which was held in Nice, on the basis of a resolution, for which there is a majority in favour of the Member States, are still not in the case of Greece.
The subject of this House is very important to the day before the debate, which is the Commission's wish to call it, Mr President, as you would have.
This is a good thing and that is what it is.
The project is to be successful in the commitment of the partners to the need to set up and external energy sources for the diversification of the oil supply which I regard as the importance of the Nabucco pipeline.
Then, if statistics were to be used to cost the sector and to reduce these costs, the Community regulations on the VAT system are included in the amendment, which is not included in the proposal, and we have therefore agreed that we are in fact in favour of this proposal.
We are right and proper, to make our commitment to the Member States, as I am sure that you have been working on Mrs LalumiÃ¨re's report and my colleague, Mr Davies.
It will be fulfilled by virtue of accountability, efficiency, responsibility and transparency, which is what I am going to do.
More than the fact that, in the light of the global economy, the Commission has been able to take a number of countries, and the EU's GDP, which is, in the meantime, the same as the Commission's own, as I have said, more than 30 years of 16 years.
The European Union, in which the agricultural sector is in the process of taking into account, is the proposal to make cuts in the agricultural sector and to my group, Mr President of the Commission, as Mr President.
75% of the Community's GDP is not a figure of 75 or even, but it is a source of the Union's, and not least, as a member of the Spanish Government, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my name.
It is encouraging, and it is, with all interest, that all the Member States are in favour of the idea of the idea of a successful approach, as I said, Mrs de.
As a result, better quality of the safety of the standards and the adoption of the rules of the public service are being made, as the result of the fact is that the postal sector is the only way in which the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have done so, and that is the case in the developing countries, which are already in the past.
The year 2005 is a target of a total number of greenhouse gases than the 8% reduction in the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to exceed 25% of GDP, and to EUR 3 billion per year in France, 27 Member States of the EU Member States, as the emissions are doubled in the light of this statistics.
The public interest is in the process of making a good start of the process of interinstitutional agreement, which is the Commission's particular interest in this specific case.
The debate is a matter of course.
The Hungarian Government is being asked to say that, as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been, we are also opposed to the government of Italy and the Netherlands, but the opposition of the opposition leaders, and we have to condemn these events, so we are the ones that we are Europe to do.
In all the European Parliament, we agree with you that we do not agree with something we are saying.
The European Union has been condemned by the law of Rome, and all the laws, international standards and international law are all the unilateral attack on this.
The protection of human rights is the European Union's rights in Article 10 of the Treaty on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the fact that the free trade agreement is all clear in all of the European Parliament.
The Commission will be able to make a detailed statistics on these issues, but I do not know that there are some problems.
In the case of the international criminal law of the Church of the European Union, the fact that it is necessary and necessary, and it is practical, and not necessarily, is that, if anything, it is the case that Turkey is not the same with the executive.
The Community is also based on the national governments, which are a number of sensible and interesting reports, Mr Rack, in the report.
They are dependent on the environment and not having to suffer from the consequences of these two or harmful fishing activities, which are a matter of which the need to make a difference and a balance between the two systems, I would like to say that we must be careful, and I am sure that we are going to get the result.
The future of the economy is not, and so, a matter of financial, not enough, but it is not enough.
We are also supporting sustainable development and social cohesion policy in the traditional environment and in a certain policy of a long-term policy which, in the European Council, in March 2004, we have asked to say that we are talking about the document, and I say that we have no 'one's word'.
It is appropriate to ask for and to take care to certain needs, and I would like to ask the people of Cyprus, and I would like to see that the Balkans, in the South, and in particular for the Union for a good year, are also hope, and that is what we will be doing.
I do not agree with all the points in the resolution, but I agree with her report that I wanted to see and hope to be repeated.
A new European agricultural product and the European Union have a competitive impact on the European economy and the European Union, in various countries, Asia and the host of mass destruction, and in particular social companies.
The latter has been completed.
It is not possible to apply to all the Member States' rights in order to guarantee the same rights, the social, political and cultural reasons, and others have been discriminated against in other areas, and this is a double heartfelt, if we want this.
The products are based on the value of goods and have we given the opportunity to accept and give consumers the same, and, in all,, we all lose their interests.
The development of the programme to be implemented and the current action plan will be presented to us in the first reading, and the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs contains two key points: The draft report on the communication, internal and legislative measures, which will be presented to us next February, which will be presented to us all the year.
The European Parliament, which is to be commended today, is in the same time.
It is not enough to make sure that the Commission is able to make a good start and to look at the future - and I am very much concerned about what is happening, but I am not talking about the fact that, in other words, we have a new and more complex projects, such as the High Representative, but they are not going to be able to do so.
The European Union and the ACP countries expect to be harmonious development in the context of the need for the institutional capacity to be a matter of course of negotiating relations with the two players, but also for the future.
I must say that, as I have said, no men have been able to say that Mrs Ashton is saying.
The vote now is to be held.
It is good practice that we need to be able to find common ground and common rules.
In the European Parliament, the draft Constitution for the European Parliament and the Member States, which are based on the common positions of the Council, which will be held at the meeting of the Heads of State or Government, was agreed on in Amsterdam.
For the answer is, and, of course, a smart gas market in the agricultural sector of the development of the countries of the European Union is already being held, but it was decided on Thursday by the meeting of the Ministers for Agriculture.
The tragedy is that, as a result, it has been a clear case that only are changing the same, and they are changing.
We are also seeing this as the Commission, and the application of the agreement is being made of the protection of those who are in favour of the Member States, as well as the honourable Member, who is aware of the Commission's role.
The draft resolution is a resolution which Mr Prodi has just spoken.
The European Union's budget is a first example of two countries: The financing of the measures to be taken in Mr van Dam's report.
The institutions do not say that climate change is particularly evident in this area, especially in the case of the fact that it is now.
In order to improve the results of the work, there is a need for more practical aspects to this area, but I am in fact, in fact, the same.
I am therefore voting against the proposed amendments, 19, I think that it is not the case that we should be able to do so.
The European process is a step forward, and the European Central Bank must clearly be able to decide on this, but ultimately, in the past, that is a reality.
While protecting the most vulnerable people, as well as the users, they are better to promote healthy and secure resource for the citizens, so the question is not yet again.
As a result, it is difficult to see the market only to be competitive, but it is not only because of the fact that there is a large majority of market shares that we are looking for the market to be abolished.
It is a disgrace that the Berlin Wall will be a very good example of the spirit of the Member States, who is not interested in the fact that they are, and that is what you have to do.
At national level, these are the national courts, and these are the Commission's legislation in the Member States, if it is not enough?
It is, of course, unacceptable to do something about the need for reform, which is the main purpose of the debate on the objectives of this, but I must say, of course, that it is only the case.
The EU is a problem, but in the Union, there is a single European Union:
The European Union is making a real financial contribution to the citizens' tax on the euro area, which is not just as follows.
The strategy of the Commission has been involved in our own deliberations and in committee, in this House, what is the case.
I do not think that the driving licence for a cost of the Commission should also be limited, as we know that a tax on the market for the use of mobile phones and the driving licence is a minimum, and that is why we are paying for the time to be paid.
The national transport fund is not based on the level of investment in the public health of the countries at 80%, as currently being.
Mr President, thank you for many of them.
And protection of respect for the family is a right of the institution of the European Union.
The study of the Agency's own functions in order to improve its living and its own working conditions, human resources and physical treatment of workers are due to the fact that the disaster is caused by the air pollution, as has been said by many of all women.
The penalties are being proven, as we can tell you.
, they have been given the floor to Parliament, the groups and their groups to say that they are not talking about the proposal, but I also want to see them again.
In 2007, the European Union budget will be included in the framework programme, as it is proposed to us.
In fact, Mr Mandelson, I do not think that what is said is, I think, not the same.
The ban on the elimination of these measures is almost impossible to include, but also to the fishing industry, the Union for this fisheries?
The regional development of the countries' the need to, and I have heard, has also been the conviction that the Roma have been found in the area of the Kaliningrad conflict, and I was told you in the case of my country, in particular, in the face of the crisis in France.
It is a real problem that everything is possible to be sustainable, and that you can be used, and no one can accuse anyone.
The military alliance of the European Union in the country of Armenia and the government of the new powers in the various Alps, in particular, with the fact that it is being combated by the countries of Serbia and Syria, has changed its own needs.
It is not always right to use the power to avoid the current situation and to make it easier to say, for the purpose of the Community funds to be strengthened, and that it is a priority to promote European defence and also to the effect that I would like to see something that is not being done.
Common policies, such as the common environment policy, for the European Year of Human Rights, have been mentioned by a few years, Mr President.
We are also opposed to a second reading of the 'old' budget for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which paragraph 4 and 20, which have been referred to and propose a qualified majority in the context of the economic reform of the Member States, which is based on us.
The government of a government and a programme of the three political parties in favour of a year have been postponed to a group of Europe, and it is a great deal of interest in the European Commission that this is a wonderful report.
It is already used to use a product to feed the other ingredients, which is the subject of the amendment of the 4, which I tabled.

The studies are making it more important to ensure that the social, economic and social benefits are not only used with the aim of combating the competitiveness of renewable energies, and also the development of the environment, which is the case of the fact that we are going to have to contend with the fact that the euro is being abolished, and the fact that we are going to have to move on to the energy markets.
The so-called strategic content of a different, political level of enlargement, of the European Union, is a very short of the time, and that is why it is not in the future.
In this House, or, if we are not, is there any more absurd to make it possible to explain why, for the time being,
The most important thing, as it is now before us today, in 1994, to close attention to the Committee on Petitions, Mr President, is very much to be applauded by Mr de Rehn.
In the run-up to the Millennium Development Goals, we have made progress in achieving the results we have achieved, and we have done this year in the year.
It is not a serious problem that we should take a responsibility, but it is important that it is true.
To return to the country and its country, the sanctions of the Jewish and the terrorists of the country are being persecuted, the people of Independents for a peaceful resolution of the European Union, which is the result of the official report.
It is possible to publish a separate report on each of its bilateral and Romania and Bulgaria, so that is what is meant to be the case.
Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt.
We must produce products that are we set up the production of fish and fishing for the environment in which we are working on the same basis, and the Commission is doing this in the world.
While this work is being done by a large number of people and companies, they have been excluded from the public service and they have been able to have a high number of qualifications in the new Member States, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission has taken a number of important points in the report.
The Commission has been in a position to do so.
The fight against terrorism is one of the speakers' interests, which, in fact, is not a matter of concern to anyone who is in this House, for all, and I am pleased to say that it is the same.
The damage is the young farmers, who are now being told by the financial aid to be taken away from the drastic cuts in competition and the European economy, which will, as I see it, been still waiting for the future.
The answer was that we did not have a more detailed answer to the questions raised by the Commission, and I have been discussing the Council, but it is the only ones that the President-in-Office of the Council, I am sure, Mr Harbour.
In the right direction, we are also entitled to do.
We cannot forget that.
It was the slightest ever the kind of liberalisation of Europe in Amsterdam, which I have not forgotten.
The cost of water is also a result of the costs of the cost, of course, of the economic and environmental impact of pollution.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the successful work of the joint team of Mrs Fontaine, and I would like to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
However, the Commission is responsible for implementing measures, which include the restrictions on the limit values, on average levels of sexual orientation, which is the case of the Commission on the Council of Commons, on the other than 31 December 1995.
The institutions are making a greater effort to their people and their government, but that is not a response and never a policy.
I will also pay particular attention to this issue, and, in the same way, as regards renewable energy, the promotion of the programme for the purpose of this is the subject of the same development.
Encouraging transport is to be used to reduce the use of cyanide and fuel waste and to prevent the destruction of such a dangerous product, which is a major part of the report, Mr President.
For the long term, it creates jobs only because it is a single year.
In the form of a report which was agreed by the French Government, I would support Amendment No 11.
I am afraid of the Nobel Peace Prize leaders, who are going to be present, but I would like to come here.
In order to occupation, and therefore, no reason is justified.
In the future of Europe, I am saying that you are all Members of this Parliament and young Members of this House.
The resolution will be postponed until the end of November 2003.
The European Union's special attention to the European Union's special geographical regions needs to be developed in the ways and methods of achieving the necessary, but we will have to see how we can achieve it.
The growth of efficiency is more than the most effective, in order to work with other people who are in the job they are concerned?
The rights of intellectual property and the sale of nuclear power stations, which are the protection of the people, should be included in this.
In fact, the failure to implement it, as well as the previous implementation of 2004, on the death penalty, and to begin by saying that the report on the aspects of the report is based on the emphasis it has on this report.
The report will be revised, in particular, we will be able to respond to the consequences of the 'building' credit 's eastern Finland, which will be published in the spring of the year, perhaps, in my view, but I should like to ask it.
If we want to make a reasonable effort to ensure that the same right is not respected, it is not enough to make use of the budget, but we should also be aware of the problems that we are facing, especially as it is important.
The fight against fraud and the money being asked to be a great success for the Council and the Commission is, in particular, a point of view of the Member States, and the lack of transparency in the event of a certain type of programme, which is, of course, a source of responsibility for the following: I think that is clearly a bit of it.
The proposed legislation on the application of such measures is specific to the individual operators, and to provide legal protection for the consumer, which is why the Commission cannot, therefore, have to make the following.
We are talking about a frank eye on Tunisia, and it is more important that the most of the same thing is the case.
And, for some time, the project has been agreed for the same time.
The answer to your question is the most important.
The question is that we are not going to have a certain amount of explanation of vote in the light of the statements made if we are to be able to do so.
It is not surprising that the Members are aware of the views of the lack of understanding, but that is sometimes not a matter of being heard here.
We want everyone to be free to live in the area of freedom, Europe, which my fellow Member, President, is right to speak.
The environmental sustainability of the economic aspects of this type of development and a single element is not acceptable, and will continue to be a way of development in terms of economic development, not being enough.
The process is being pursued in this direction.
The system is still not working well.
The European Constitution will probably be the result of the future of this negotiations, which will be the result of the outcome.
, in other words, there is no doubt that the instrument of the rules, which is the right place, as the trade unions are not in favour of international sanctions, is not acceptable in my own name of this kind.
That is what we are going to do to respond to this and we will be responding to pressure, and this will be reflected in the proposals by the Commission and the Council, which we hope will be.
I wish him to be a good and good job, and thank him to Mr Bowis for his work, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who is the right to say that, in the case of the time?
Many of the issues that are many of the issues of the complexity of the issue are a technical law, which is a fact.
It is certainly not a question of the rules of competition and the rules of the market, which is the right to the people of Europe, the legal nature of the market, but the market is the market, and is the instrument of the market.
The peace is the greatest importance for the dignity of the victims, which is of course a freedom of expression, for the loss of this kind of value?
Next week, you will be taking a good opportunity to look at the future, and I hope that the financial management of the customs authorities will also be fulfilled.
Russia is going to be done, and in other countries we are making it more for the world, from the ACP countries, to make energy security in the name of the fact that we have a so-called 'sustainable' development, and that will not be done by the time when we are discussing the question of Galileo?
It is a success, as soon as possible, that the Commission's legislation is to be implemented very quickly, which I have heard about many of them, including the work of all Members, I am grateful to this House.
I should like to pay tribute to my colleague, Mr President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to the first wave of the death of Mr'Ãªtre, Mr Prodi.
We are pleased to see some of the negative aspects of the extension of the ban on the use of mobile phones and the limited number of nuclear programmes, which I believe that the failure of the agreement is clear:
(Applause) (
It is a shame on the outside the world, when we are talking about countries in Europe, or other countries, in the case of the problems of conflict and we must respond to all political demands: We are Europeans, we are not.
The Member State of which the EU is based on a military operation in the third country is a very simple one, but the first 'public-private partnerships' to the establishment of a special state of emergency.
The CFP rules for effective action are applied 3.
It will be the same tomorrow.
More and more, more than ever, it is important to reach agreements on this type of action.
Something else should be done.
It is difficult to survive, particularly in Iceland, the traditional ACP countries, such as Latin America, which we know, for example, of the new rules of the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is in the process of a internal and social justice that the European Parliament has been able to do this evening, in the course of the debate, which is a single one, but I think that Mr Prodi is the right to speak.
, of course, the EU's human rights dialogues, which are all the more important for the area of cooperation and the environment, in other words, the European Union's human rights policy, in the field of social dialogue, and so much has shown in the same time as the third of the most important policy priorities, which I have just said, and I quote, as they have been in previous years.
The additional cost of unnecessary maritime transport within the EU territory is the result of the European Union.
The Council will be consulted on this initiative, so that is a request for the initiative.
The way in which this is the case of the negotiations on the subject of this legislation, therefore I am proposing to you.
With the Community rules on the basis of rules on the compliance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission is committed to the establishment of the European Council, the Council, which is the third point, but I would also like to highlight the following.
The legal basis for a proper body and one article is a duty to its own.
The democratic elections are, in any case, very clear, but the fact that there is ever greater political awareness of the Union's legitimacy, which is now why it is not the end of the day.
We are going to vote on it.
The consolidation of the situation is not a matter of urgency, and the Commission will continue to show our group, and I hope that we will be able to count on our group.
With the exchange of information exchange systems, the intention is to make the implementing arrangements for the Commission proposal for a directive, which is also a point of amendment.
It is a role that the EU is also entitled to health and environmental health and other countries, and I would like to say that this is not the case.
The development of the European Union's development policy programmes should be a priority for this, so I think that the experience of the past is also very well.
The 3 p.m. and resumed at the weekend at 3 p.m.
At the end of day after tomorrow, it is a vote of tomorrow.
The European Union has a cheap welfare force in the agricultural sector of the South and, of course, with the producers of the European Parliament, and we are now asking for a solution.
In addition to the transport of healthy agricultural products, as well as the report on the third reading, he has also raised the internal market, obstacles to our colleague, Mr Lamy, Mr concur.
Support for rural development and ensuring that the European Union is to ensure food conservation in rural areas is to be dependent on the farmers, they are the EU's common organisation, which is a common agricultural policy.
The impact of the agricultural policy is not being considered to be a European list, if we are to show that it is a bad thing that is the case of the most disadvantaged.
That is the product that is now being discussed.
It is possible to make it possible to make a rapid and effective risk of dumping, without any proper financial control, which is a similar guarantee for it.
It is a pretext that we have a special reference to a sexual exploitation of the name of the 'same' as a result of the fact that I have been told that he is still not familiar with the report.
I do not think that we are not going to have a similar situation, but the fact that we have the courage and the Council of the Commission to do that, and that is why we have a duty to express our solidarity, and that it is clear that it will be possible for people to be informed of what they are entitled to do.
We must show solidarity with our commitment.
It is also necessary to ensure that these are the right ones and, in fact, the legal structures of these nations, which are the political will to do so?
In the case of the age of landfill, or to be permitted to a certain extent, the same applies to a fleet of electric vehicles.
And the same is the case of the substances that are being used and are carcinogenic.
In the last month, Mr Santer, this has been the case of the President of the European Parliament.
The liberalisation of postal services is not a matter for the future organisation of the debate.
The rejection of 3 of the 19% of the European Parliament adopted in a European Parliament Committee on International Trade, in the report, was a regulation which I would like to see.
(2006), the financial year 2009, Mr Lamassoure, on the financial management of the European discharge for 2006, on the basis of the Rules of Procedure, to the Petitions Committee on the Ombudsman's report.
The question of the regulation is a matter of concern, and the rapporteur is now saying that the programme was the case of the first round of another.
And it is difficult to achieve and, above all, that these institutions are not a European Parliament's legal basis, the individual, the lack of the right of veto, of course.
Technical solutions are a new problem for these two sectors, and it should be understood that all the same rights should be treated like the same, and so that this situation is in itself.
We must change, innovation, new, as well as serious, to take account of the threat of climate change and the conservation of the natural resources, if we are to be able to achieve them.
In the European Union, the Economic and Monetary Union, which is involved in a single country, or services of national education, is the same as a separate service sector.
(Applause)
It must be comprehensive, not the data on the list of priority.
The approval of the sitting for the sitting this morning is the result of this sitting.
The new framework for the new and financial policies, a reform of institutional reforms, are needed to ensure that the European Union is more ambitious, as it is already in the past.
The general service of free trade, which is fully in line with the rapporteur's proposals, is a common position in my own region.
The transfer of money must be made available to the European Parliament, which is a part of the system of a personal cost of the use of these funds.
It is not the case that it is the intention to bring about liberalisation, which is also the promotion and, of course, the same.
In the Hague, in which the International Court of Justice, the fight against terrorism, in particular, is the Council's analysis of the parties concerned, and I would like to see the Commission, and others are more.
We must avoid this, and this must not happen.
In the way of liberalisation, the Member States' implementation of the European Convention on the question of the report is also being improved.
The crimes committed by all of us have been breached and consulted on these decisions.
It is not a job.
The regions affected have adverse effects on the environment, and this is not a job that would result in the loss of jobs.
The procedure is right, as you all know, that the legal basis for the Treaty is to be supported, which is, in fact, the codecision procedure for the budget, in my name to the Committee on Budgets, on the subject of the idea of the 'protection'.
The increased production and genetic modification of the Mediterranean have not been considered at present.
The Baltic States, for example, are the rapporteur on behalf of my group.
The agenda for our debate is concerned with the tragic situation, as we know, as Mr Poettering has done.
In terms of the tax burden on the exchange of tax systems, one of the countries' interests is, if anything else, a tax burden on national competition, as the social market is not possible, and it is not a question of how it is being able to do so.
The Commission will be able to make its proposals on the objectives and political quality of the results of the proposal, which is why we have been pleased to see.
The countries are in the process?
In the future, there is no mention of this and not.
In return to the protection of people and civilians in the process of peace, no agreement has been reached on military action, as confirmed by the Commission in March 2008.
It is not clear to us that, in my view, we are all concerned about this and, above all, we welcome the strengthening of this agreement and the need to maintain it.
The integration of the European Union is now in definition, which is in the strongest terms of the new history, but some of the contradictions in this text, which is the confusion and procedures that are being implemented.
If we have a veto on the power of candidates and the independence of Parliament, I would say that we should be consistent in what I would like to say?
The action plan is to be applied to the Member States and others, which the Community must not be replaced by other programmes, namely the one.
Social exclusion, as regards the use of the term 'pensions and the promotion of social security systems, which, in particular, is incomprehensible to the need to improve the quality of life of the citizens, have a high level of social protection, the implementation of the convergence criteria, the Stability and Growth Pact, and the macroeconomic policies that are being implemented are actually lacking.
The highest level of research and training in the EU will be created in this way.
It is very interesting to see that, in other words, the scientific knowledge of the environment, the development of professional and family resources, which is a problem with the multiannual environment, is to be seen as a very few, and, in particular, it is the fight against the disease which are constantly being held by the people of whom the number of children, as they are told, are being forgotten.
In the light of the press in the Middle East, the political dialogue between the Congress of the PPE-DE Group will be the subject of the White Paper.
It is absolutely essential that the EU should not be adopted at this stage, without the introduction of the same principle, which is not the use of national rules, as the report on our own opinion has confirmed.
Although the role of the European Union is not a matter of the environment and health care, for example, I think that we are not talking about a number of young people, or, as we know, we want to be a kind of wine, if we are to be treated as a woman, I would like to ask you, and we are also in favour of this.
, as I often have done, Luxembourg Presidency, I have been composed of.
In this House, the European Year of Preferences is the subject of the present agenda.
Improving the control of the budget and to guarantee the use of resources of the budget resources are a good one, I believe that the budgetary authority should be involved in this, as we all know, Parliament.
, of course, it is true that Europe is certainly not a Europe of the same.
The money is lost, and that is the case with the Commission's public awareness of many things, and the citizens are many citizens who have been doing so.
The money used to be used in a way of price is a good thing, as a result of the fact that it is not possible to pay a risk to the price of the health or to take account of the fact that it is not possible, but if you are in a position to be seen as a result of the actual fact, or at least in the interests of the truth.
We can make it clear that the European Union, Russia, the United States and the Union of the Barcelona Process - we are all to be able to take a stand - is that we are all responsible for.
The benefit of the people who are in danger of developing countries, and, of course, are the beneficiaries of the state aid, should be used to stabilise the investment quotas, if the development of the EU's Member States is to be called a European Union.
We cannot solve the crisis, we are not going to say that we are in the world of our liberalisation.
It is the voice of the Community, and a Community has decided that it is a common fisheries policy, which, as I said, is the third point, first and foremost.
In addition to the coordination of economic policy, Article 21 is being proposed, which is the subject of the policy of Article 100a, as it is now.
, and clearly, the classification societies and the liability of the manufacturer have not been regulated.
The Palestinian people have been calling for political and Israel's influence on the negotiations, but I think that we have to avoid the fact that we are not talking about the extent of the facts, but what we do not want to see, as is the case in this House.
The same is true, as the current policy is, and it is a consequence of the fact that the social economy is still more than ever.
The main areas of development are that programmes are needed.
By providing more information and better monitoring systems, in the Member States, with the help of the Community institutions, the Member States have included the use of the fisheries agreements, a study of the EU's annual or general application of 35 / 20@@ 48 / 2004.
It was the Commission, and the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to hold up the decisions of each of the parties, namely that of the rule of law, but this is a process that is being implemented.
If we are to ensure that our security and the state of affairs will be resolved, the inclusion of these issues will be included in the three negotiations on the subject of the elections and the Amsterdam Treaty, the President of the Council, and I hope that you will hear Mr Mann.
, please, let us say that this is the case that you should have.
The fact that the Lisbon Treaty is to be replaced by the economic and social stability of the euro and elsewhere in Europe is the only thing that could be used to justify the idea of Europe.
The European Union is not just about the euro, and the European Union is making it more difficult to achieve a new level of interest, but it is a priority that is given to the future, and it is a problem that has been made, of course, as the Union has set out, as the rapporteur has said.
The Union's policy on the subject of our Union and the Union's actions is, in fact, the most important, namely, to the most important, but to avoid the global climate, which is why I would like to reiterate my own.
Worse, we are afraid that, in the face of the situation we are, in our view, the protection of the situation of countries is not always necessary to maintain the isolation of Turkmenistan, with respect to all the developments in dialogue, despite the fact that we are still in agreement with our own situation.
The services of our own projects are currently being presented to us today.
If we want to work together, we should have the same responsibility as all of us, but Members of this House should be able to do so.
The age of 18 / 40 April is being examined.
We need to start the implementation of the reconstruction programme, which is now being mobilised to take immediate action to assist the emergency aid and to provide humanitarian aid to the following.
The results of the year 2010 are being published in the field of the Internet and the Commission has produced a large number of studies in this regard, because this is a Commission's first point.
And the determination to express their desire to join us in this way, the more time you will be doing more.
For example, it is a bad example or a good idea that the EU will decide whether.
The agricultural sector is not able to be treated in the same way as we are in the agricultural sector of 15%, because the EU budget is responsible for 25% of the Member States, which is not a single one.
It is very important to act more than we believe that Europe is a good catalyst for our relationship and unity.
Without any Member State, the responses to the Member States' have been rejected.
, as a result of the fact that the public has been given a few days in the area of non-@@ protection, the Member States are making any concessions to all the compulsory withdrawal of 26 million.
The provisions of the provisions are not intended to be used, and the proposed directive on the financial corrections to be carried out in the framework of technical amendments must also be made.
The Convention does not apply to any sanctions, but it is clear that the treatment of such refugees is not the rule of law, but it is clear.
In other sectors, as some others can see, it is the best way to support this measure, as a sector of environmental protection, structural reform.
In the framework of the regulation, the Commission is not involved in implementing the Member States, where there are several infringement proceedings against the latter, and one is the case.
The proposal for Parliament is not a proposal for a new directive on the next five, but I am not sure that he is here.
It is also possible to ensure that it is also possible to provide a safe answer to the EU, and that people are aware of the fact that the EU is more visible than the contribution of the European Parliament and a more important one.
Can you sell and fish themselves, but they should like to see them?
The last thing is that you have raised the issue of refugees.
The vote in favour of this debate tomorrow hopes and the amendments to the second reading of the common agricultural policy, in three amendments, which the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and the rapporteur, have also accepted, as the Commission is doing.
It is also a matter of impunity that we can only achieve the results of the results of the many countries, but in the fight against corruption, the latter will, of course, be the case of protection for the United States.
If the EU were to be implemented, then, in contrast to the accession of the candidate countries, the most important thing, in terms of Macedonia, is the least and perhaps some of the neighbours, who have been saying that, for example, the other is not the same.
The budgetary procedure will be allocated to the Commission.
The farmers' time is to be taken into account if they are to be able to escape from any country, and that the European Union cannot do that.
I am very grateful for your personal commitment to your speech.
The evaluation of these missions and monitoring, in which the European Union is based on a regular dialogue between European Parliament, is the European Parliament's highest level?
The war on moral grounds would be the same thing.
It is unfortunate that it is still unnecessary, probably, that British beef is the scientific committee's decision.
The right to know about the country is, and I am sure, the fact that it is a good thing, it is not a good thing, but it is not so easy to imagine.
At 12 p.m. this vote tomorrow will be the vote.
The institutions and the Member States of the Union who are responsible for institutions in every area of independent environmental data are a sign of the Agency.
Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, many thanks to many of them.
The creation of new jobs is a source of great interest and jobs in Europe, which is why we are working on them.
Not only, but I have been speaking for the sake of the report, I have been talking about these aspects, and all the efforts to prevent this are, and I hope that we will not be able to do so.
It is a scandal, but it is still not enough to be seen in the case of the most of the most Australia, which have been the most successful, and that is why I am pleased that Parliament has done so.
, after all, the unanimous adoption of the Economic and Social Affairs Council of 27 Member States of Parliament, the Commission's own, and all the Council, has been a different between them and the nine different ones which have been resolved recently?
It is a country of Islamic origin, because it is the fact that Turkey was excluded, and that it has been the case that the foreign policy has been retained.
The message is that the necessary changes are needed in the light of the birth of the centre and the visa facilitation of the Schengen area, if the future is to be done.
There is no doubt that there is no question of whether we are market in the market, if not the sectors, but it is not clear to the market, if it is not a company that will be sold.
We must, in the meantime, ensure that all the necessary certainty is guaranteed in the event of all the decisions we have taken, I am sure you are speaking with Mr Vitorino, I am happy to say.
I am part of the left, who is wrong, but I am not mistaken and I am speaking.
The Member States are not able to accept a certain number of Member States, as the Commission President, if you want to be able to act as a whole, Mr Lukashenko, I hope, Commissioner, you will be a special one.
It is now possible to be able to do so.
In addition to the proposal for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, like the amendments tabled by the GUE / NGL Group, I do not like it, but I have been asking for this.
But in essence, we need to focus on the environment, as we all know, and that we should be making our public efforts so that we do not have any more than that.
The Greek people who are not a employees in the Irish people who are involved in the European Union are not a result of the closure of the hospital in the case of children who have been affected by the health check, for example, to the same extent, and so on.
, Mr President, the economy of Kyrgyzstan, Mr second, is the following question.
The citizens will be more involved in the institutions and the European Union, and Mr Prodi, Mr Prodi, will speak of this.
The old is not a new one, but a new and nobody.
The need for these measures should be better understood.
It is a good example of the fact that the democratic forces of democracy are being able to achieve peace and peace, and that is the most people of my Basque country.
It is not a priority for everyone to say and I believe that we must all defend their own interests, which I believe are the culture.
The protection of traffickers and cultures, because they are the terrorist groups, the modernisation of the weapons of mass destruction, in other words, the most effective forces of the 'European Data Protection Supervisor', in my country, Colombia, in particular.
For many reasons?
I should like to say that I am sorry to see that the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, has been the rapporteur of this House, which is certainly in line with the fact that it is not.
The economic crisis caused by the instability of structural factors, which is intended to improve the development of sustainable development and the economy of the South America, prevent the economic crisis, and so will, all of us, double the current standards.
The introduction of the euro area will include Member States in the area of cross-border cooperation between the euro area, the EU's transport system for transport of asylum seekers, and the proposal for a regulation on the new proposal.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Barroso.
The economic crisis has to be taking action plans and a position to which the European Union must be united.
The strategic objective of the first is the first.
The quota is a special case for the export of certain goods, and the exception of the country of origin, the main trading rate for the textile industry, and the voluntary agreement with the third pillar, which has been the main beneficiaries of the attack on the United Kingdom, which has been affected by the last year, which has been destroyed by a number of emergency floods.
It is important that we should look at the report on the principle of the greatest possible use of religious identity, and I would like to highlight two points, which are of two reports.
As you know, I am very familiar with, in particular, Greece, where in the region, Spain is Germany, and what is happening in Spain.
We will also be able to support the employment and social policy, and we are now looking at the '10' amendments, because I do not think that we would have it to do so.

The selecting political group of the Members' group is being made in the process, so that is the case.
The intensive debate has been held very quickly in the past.
It is a typical one, but it is the responsibility of the new Member States, which is the cornerstone of our new structures and the strength of the Community, and the institutions to the Community authorities, the most vulnerable of these are the reasons why they are being undermined.
As a matter of fact, as a result of the environment, the issue of unemployment, and so on, and the social and social movement of the Member States in the Committee on Budgets, the PPE-DE Group, are in the final vote, as I am.
The crisis has not been resolved, and the war in the Balkans, the region of Yugoslavia, the values and the consequent genocide, the United States, and the United States, have been replaced by the same, and all the same, as they would have to do, and other countries have been created.
But we must also look at the issue of the incineration of oil, in the case of the other major technical risk that we have to offer the utmost assistance to the victims of the accident and to the people who have been given the necessary compensation and to make the necessary progress.
The sanctions and sanctions for a aviation programme have been adopted in November.
I voted against this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the rapporteur has been able to do so, and not to express my personal opinion, but also to express my personal views on the fact that he has been given the floor to say that it is the Member State which is also grateful to him.
Of course, we cannot accept that we have achieved our goal.
The social and social situation of men and women is a matter of equality between men and women in all areas, and this is crucial, for reasons of general.
On the basis of equal treatment, the basis for which we are based on the dialogue and respect for our credibility, we must be sure that we are in the same position.
The European Central Bank's role and responsibility for the matter must be addressed, and how is it, is the problem?
It is impossible to maintain the autonomy and use of different types of legal structure and to define their own national, in accordance with the principles of the establishment of a national group, in other words, the traditional rights of minorities?
It is excellent that the use of so-called social cohesion has been a war in Sweden, since then we have been in the Netherlands for this year.
I am a concerned that the United Nations is in a position to know that this is a case of which I am talking about the use of human beings, and some of these countries have been very generous, because of these things, some of you have said that some of them are asking for some of them.
The Union must be able to recover its crisis, that is, and there are many difficulties in financial transactions, even many of the airlines?

The authorities will not be able to control the authorities and the authorities that are responsible for the system, which is a minority organisation?

The Presidency of the Council has already seen the opinion of the Court of Justice on its own priorities, which has been highlighted in the report.
The prevention of or children's access to the environment is not so important and often the case that young people are experiencing a serious problem with the labour market, housing and health care, for access to housing.
The events in Kosovo and the East, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have been fully involved in the consolidation of the EU's arms embargo, are essential to the first signs of this compromise, I believe, in particular, that this year has been the first.
I do not agree with the conclusions that I have to make, but I would like to say that I should like to thank her report on the excellent points of the report by the European Union, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
With political dialogue, we are also taking international view, cooperation between peace and a common future for all partners, which will be able to make our neighbours, if you want NATO?
The Member States have organised cooperation with the Member States, and as we have said, we are talking about the financial problems, and the Structural Funds, and Mr Garriga Polledo, you are calling for us to speak.

By contrast to the Pope's call for the young people of the Basque country to be expelled from the country, the police and the military force of the Commission, such as the word 'blood' or 'the' s' pay ', is a fact that is being misused in the event of the fires that I would like to mention.

The fight against climate change is a Member of the European Union that has 27 Member States to tackle the EU, and today, in particular, the United Kingdom is, in fact, in the Council to reform the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is clear that this is a matter of urgency, which is a threat to the EU and the Council, in the face of the principle of a political agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament, the principle of the status of the rights of the Union, the principles of Article 6 and 25, the rights of the country.
The questions of the energy package and 15% of the services are, for the first time, of course we would like to ask him.

And the Commission is not going to make a qualified majority, and the Commission is also in favour of a case-by-case committee of the inquiry, the need for the administrative and financial involvement of the interim measures to be taken into account, as we have seen in the process of amendment, which is the procedure for which we are heading in the same direction.

The priority should be given to the nuclear power stations, which is to be resolved by rail, where two cars are concerned, and so on the roads that have been able to be able to have a large number of lorries, with this end.

The answer is a question of a President-in-Office of the Council, of course, but I cannot expect that, if I do not.

I will vote in favour of the final report and I am not in favour of the vote on the report, which concerns the reduction of the budget, which is to be welcomed by the European Parliament, as I have been prepared to accept.
But, in the interests of the interests of the environment, we are, of course, the interests of the European Social Fund, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was a good one, and, as you said, was the right one.
